# object diff

Get the minimal patch to extend objectA with to transform it into
objectB

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

Consider an object retrieved from a server:

```js
{
	name: 'Peter',
	age: 26,
	height: 187,
}
```

Now the user changes stuff using some frontend (e.g. a HTML form) and
ends with:

```js
{
	name: 'Peter',
	age: 27,
	height: 186,
}
```

When he hits save, you only want to send off the changed parts to the
server, to save bits (because you'r indeed a programmer), but also to
avoid any unnecessary "merge conflicts" at the server.

Imagine two users changing the same object; if they did not change the
exact same keys of the object, the last user won't erase the first
user's changes - in a lot of cases, that's the expected behavior.

## Install

```
npm install object-diff
```

## Usage

```js
var objectDiff = require('object-diff');

var a = {
	speed: 4,
	power: 54,
	height: undefined,
	level: 1,
};

var b = {
	speed: 4,			// unchanged
	power: 22,			// changed
	level: undefined,	// changed
	weight: 10,			// added
};

objectDiff(a, b);
/*
{
	power: 22,
	level: undefined,
	weight: 10,
}
*/
```
